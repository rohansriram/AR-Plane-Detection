# AR-Plane-Detection
# Problem:
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a solution to detecting a flat plane and placing a 3D object on its surface

# Relavent Research:
&nbsp;&nbsp;1) SIFT vs ORB vs SURF Feature Detectors: [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02726)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Both SIFT and ORB are available on opencv and are open-source  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*We found SIFT was better able to keep points after image transformations than ORB  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*However, SIFT was unable to attain realtime performance, so the ORB feature detector was used
